# NeuroSTF
NeuroSTF is a time-series forecasting model using neuroplastic sparse attention with temporal convolution and MLP layers. Inspired by brain plasticity, it dynamically prunes and regrows attention weights during training, improving efficiency and accuracy for multivariate long-range forecasting tasks.
